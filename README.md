### What I learned

By working on this age calculator project, I gained several valuable skills and insights:

-1. Date Manipulation in JavaScript:
I learned how to work with JavaScript's Date object to handle dates, calculate differences, and account for various complexities like leap years and different month lengths.

-2. Conditional Logic and Validation:
I practiced writing conditional logic to ensure that inputs are valid and handled correctly, such as dealing with invalid dates or adjusting calculations based on user input.

-3. Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS:
Through this project, I became more familiar with Tailwind CSS, particularly in creating responsive layouts, handling different screen sizes, and managing complex class-based styling.

-4. Problem-Solving and Debugging:
I enhanced my problem-solving skills by troubleshooting issues with layout, positioning, and JavaScript errors. I learned how to debug and refine my code through iteration.

-5. User Experience Considerations:
I considered the end-user experience, ensuring that the app provides accurate results and that the interface is intuitive and visually appealing.

### Useful resources
